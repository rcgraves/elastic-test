This QUICK and DIRTY script is designed to allow you to quickly and easily experiment with the Elastic stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) on Security Onion.

This script assumes that you've already installed the latest Security Onion 14.04.5.2 ISO image as follows:
* (1) management interface with full Internet access
* (1) sniffing interface (separate from management interface)

This script will do the following:
* disable ELSA (if it was enabled)
* install Docker and download Docker images for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana
* import our custom visualizations and dashboards
* configure syslog-ng to send logs to Logstash on port 6050
* configure Apache as a reverse proxy for Kibana and authenticate users against Sguil database
* update CapMe to leverage that single sign on (SSO) and integrate with Elasticsearch
* update Squert to use SSO

Depending on the speed of your hardware and Internet connection, this process will take at least 10 minutes.

TODO
For the current TODO list, please see:
https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion/issues/1095

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
The Elastic stack requires more hardware than ELSA.  For best results on your test VM, you'll probably want at LEAST 2 CPU cores and 8GB of RAM.

THANKS
Special thanks to Justin Henderson for his Logstash configs and installation guide!

WARNINGS AND DISCLAIMERS
* This technology PREVIEW is PRE-ALPHA, BLEEDING EDGE, and TOTALLY UNSUPPORTED!
* If this breaks your system, you get to keep both pieces!
* This script is a work in progress and is in constant flux.
* This script is intended to build a quick prototype proof of concept so you can see what our ultimate Elastic configuration might look like.  This configuration will change drastically over time leading up to the final release.
* Do NOT run this on a system that you care about!
* Do NOT run this on a system that has data that you care about!
* This script should only be run on a TEST box with TEST data!
* This script is only designed for standalone boxes and does NOT support distributed deployments.
* Use of this script may result in nausea, vomiting, or a burning sensation.
